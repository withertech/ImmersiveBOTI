To develop this mod for both Fabric and Forge platform, my approach is to mainly develop the Fabric version and
 remap the platform-independent code from yarn into mcp and put into the Forge version.
The platform-specific code is in the weird-named `com.withertech.hiding_in_the_bushes` package. All other Java code is cross-platform.
If your PR changes the cross-platform part, the PR should be put on the Fabric version repository https://github.com/qouteall/ImmersivePortalsMod
